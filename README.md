# 📊 Bellabeat Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes **Fitbit fitness tracker data** (daily activity,
sleep, and hourly steps) to uncover insights about user behavior.\
It is based on the **Bellabeat Case Study** from the [Google Data
Analytics Capstone
project](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).

The analysis was performed in **Python (Pandas)**
and **SQL (SQLite)** within a Jupyter Notebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Explore the Fitbit dataset.\
-   Derive insights about activity, sleep, and calorie patterns.\
-   Demonstrate how to query CSV data using SQL.\
-   Provide actionable recommendations for Bellabeat's wellness
    products.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes multiple CSV files: - **dailyActivity_merged.csv** →
steps, calories, sedentary & active minutes\
- **sleepDay_merged.csv** → sleep duration, time in bed\
- **hourlyCalories_merged.csv** → calories count per hour\
- **heartrate_seconds_merged.csv** →  heart rate value

## 🔎 Key Insights

1.  Monthly usage of the FitBit tracker, how many users used the devices every month.\
2.  Categorize users into very active, moderately active and lightly active users based on their activity distance.\
3.  The day that has the longest sleep durantion and time in bed, the day most of the people rest in it is **Sunday**.\
4.  See the hour that every user burns the most calories in.\
5.  The user with the highest average heart rate is the user whos id is **2026352035**.
